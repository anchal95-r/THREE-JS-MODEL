### **Web Decals with JavaScript + Three.js**  
[Live Preview](https://anchal95-r.github.io/THREE-JS-MODEL/examples/webgl_decals.html)  

This project demonstrates how to apply decals to 3D models in real-time using **Three.js**. Decals allow you to project textures onto surfaces dynamically, making it possible to add **stickers, damage effects, or custom markings** to objects without modifying the underlying geometry. The project includes **interactive controls**, allowing users to place decals by clicking on the model. It showcases techniques like **raycasting, UV projection, and shader-based blending** to seamlessly integrate decals onto 3D surfaces.

### **Path Follower + Three.js**  
[Live Preview](https://anchal95-r.github.io/THREE-JS-MODEL/examples/webgl_modifier_curve.html)  

This example features a **dynamic path-following system** using **Three.js Curve Modifiers**. Objects move smoothly along predefined paths, demonstrating advanced **animation techniques** for vehicles, drones, or procedural motion in 3D scenes. The project leverages **Catmull-Rom splines and parametric curves** to create natural movement, making it useful for simulations, racing games, or AI-driven animations. Users can observe objects dynamically adjust their orientation along the curve, maintaining a natural flow.

### **Cubic Simulation + Three.js**  
[Live Preview](https://anchal95-r.github.io/THREE-JS-MODEL/examples/webgl_buffergeometry_drawrange.html)  

This project explores **buffer geometry optimizations** in **Three.js** by implementing a cubic simulation where objects appear and disappear dynamically using **draw range techniques**. The simulation efficiently handles **large numbers of vertices** by only rendering the necessary parts, improving performance for complex scenes. This technique is essential for applications like **LOD (Level of Detail) rendering, procedural world generation, and real-time simulations** where controlling the visible geometry range significantly improves performance.
